The dataset comprises grayscale images of faces, each measuring 48x48 pixels. These images have been meticulously aligned to ensure consistent positioning, with the facial features centrally positioned and occupying a uniform amount of space across all samples.
The objective at hand is to classify each facial expression into one of seven distinct emotional categories: Angry (0), Disgust (1), Fear (2), Happy (3), Sad (4), Surprise (5), and Neutral (6). This task involves leveraging advanced computational techniques to discern subtle nuances in facial expressions and accurately assign them to their respective emotional categories.
